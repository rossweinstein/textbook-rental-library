## Overview

We wish to design a computerized system for automating the operations of a textbook rental library (“Rental”) for a university.  The Rental is a university service that allows students to check out their required textbooks for courses in which they are enrolled.  Part of each student’s semester services fee goes to supporting the operation of the Rental.  This fee is paid at the beginning of each semester, and the Rental is not responsible for this billing.

The University offers multiple sections of courses during its two main terms (Fall and Spring Semester), as well as during its two shorter terms (Summer and Winter Terms, the latter between the Fall and Spring Semesters).  Courses are offered by a university department and are numbered from 001-999.  Sections are numbered from 01-99, with each taught by a single professor.  

Each University course section may use a number of different textbook titles, with students expected to check out a copy of each textbook for each course section in which they are enrolled.

The Rental physically houses and manages the stacks of copies of textbooks for student checkout before the start of each of these university sessions.  

The Rental is responsible for a number of different functions related to textbook purchasing, circulation, and inventory.  At various times during the year, different Rental tasks must be performed, and it should be easy for the manager to determine which such scheduled tasks have been performed at any given time, and which tasks are due or yet to be performed.

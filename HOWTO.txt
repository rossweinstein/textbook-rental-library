----HOW TO--------------------------------------------------------

This program allows a user to do several things…

1) It allows a Patron to check books out from the Library
2) It allows a Patron to check book back in to the Library
3) It allows a Manager to query the Database, place holds on Patron, resolve holds for Patrons, generate hold notices, and let Patron's buy books

* See the bottom for an explanation of each hold type

—————MANAGER FUNCTIONS—————————

In the manager functions menu, the user may accomplish several tasks...

In the View Records Menu, the Manager will have several options
	1) View all Patrons in the database (this will list their ID number and full name)
	2) View all Copies in the database (This will list their ID, title, and who, if anyone, has it currently checked out)
	3) View all Patrons with Holds on their records (It does not list each individual hold, just each individual Patron with a hold)
	4) View all Patrons with unreturned books (It does not list the books unreturned, just each individual Patron with unreturned books)
	5) The rest of the options will display each individual hold type, and the Patrons associated with those holds

In the Add Hold Menu, the Manager will be have a selection of different hold types. For all the options, except for Overdue, only one hold can be placed at a time. For overdue holds, the manager has the option of making all copies that are beyond their due date as overdue. Note that overdue holds only apply to Patrons with Student status. Faculty and Staff cannot received overdue holds.

In the Resolve Hold Menu, the Manager will be prompted for a Patron ID. If that Patron is found, and if that Patron does have holds on their record, the holds will be listed in a menu where individual holds can be selected for resolution.

If the Manager selects the Buy Book option, they will need to enter the Copy ID as well as confirm the book before it is able to be sold. The book is removed from the Library database once it is sold.

If the Manager selects the Generate Hold Notices options, the system will generate notices to be sent out to each Patron with a hold of any kind informing them that they will need to resolve the hold(s) before they are able to use the Textbook Rental Library again.

—————HOLDS——————————————————————

——HOLD TYPES————

TEXTBOOK HOLDS:
--OVERDUE - This hold is assigned when a Patron of Student status keeps a particular textbook beyond its due date
--UNSHELVED - This hold is assigned when Patrons do not return their textbooks to their proper shelves after checking them back in
--DAMAGE - This hold is assigned when a textbook is returned in a condition worse than when it was checked out
--LOST - This hold is assigned when a Patron cannot find their textbook to return

NON-TEXTBOOK HOLDS:
--MISC - This hold is not related to a textbook, but when something, such as a phone or backpack, is found in the Library and the Patron has yet to pick it up

——RESOLVING HOLDS————

TEXTBOOK HOLDS:
For a textbook hold to be resolved, a fine must be paid.  For overdue holds, the book must be returned as well. 

NON-TEXTBOOK HOLDS:
There are no fines to be paid with non-textbook holds.  The Patron just needs to provide ID to retrieve their item.
